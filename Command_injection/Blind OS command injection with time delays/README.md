# Lab 2 - Blind OS command injection with time delays  [PRACTITIONER]

```
This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.

By adding the  ` & sleep # `  (Note the space before & and after #) / `||ping+-c+10+127.0.0.1|| & `(URL-encode before sending) , we can see that the `email` parameter is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability, since there was time delay of 10 seconds.
> By '#' we comment out the rest of the query. Since it is a bash script that is running in the background
