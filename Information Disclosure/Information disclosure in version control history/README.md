## Overview :

- Virtually all websites are developed using some form of version control system, such as Git. By default, a Git project stores all of its version control data in a folder called `.git`.
- Occasionally, websites *expose this directory in the production environment*. In this case, you might be able to access it by simply browsing to /.git.

## Solution :

Once the website loads, check out the **.git** directory . ie - `https://<id>.web-security-academy.net/.git`. The page discloses some files like this,

### Retreive the admin's password -

To analyse these .git files we can use a tool called ![Git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper)

1. Use the command - `python3 git_dumper.py https://0a1e0026040c2e3f8297b0dc00ec003c.web-security-academy.net/.git  websecurity/.` to save the files along with the .git directory in the folder of our choice in our linux machine.
   
2. **git log** shows these two commit  logs.
```$git log```

3. Running `git diff 19dd0c8f15df85cd3526e0d51e9f912d3e52c556 63085ffc69c9cab7029684ec63ba9219cb96f851` gives us the following result which contains the admin password which was removed - **administrator:kw9sxvjbf1eqp40vwm6d**.

```git
diff --git a/admin.conf b/admin.conf
index ec58905..21d23f1 100644
